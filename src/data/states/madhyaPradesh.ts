  stateIntro: "Resting at the very heart of India, Madhya Pradesh is a land where forests, rivers, and stone-built legacies quietly converge. Vast plateaus and dense woodlands shape a landscape rich in wildlife and natural calm, while ancient temples, rock shelters, and historic towns speak of a civilization deeply rooted in time. Today, the state unfolds through growing cities, living tribal cultures, and a strong connection to its natural surroundings. From tiger-filled reserves and winding riverbanks to heritage towns and everyday rural life, Madhya Pradesh offers a grounded, unhurried experience—inviting you to explore India’s core not as a crossroads, but as a place of depth, continuity, and quiet strength.",
